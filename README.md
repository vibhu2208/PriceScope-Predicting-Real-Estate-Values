🧠 PriceScope: Predicting Real Estate Values 🎉
Welcome to PriceScope: Predicting Real Estate Values—a project that leverages Simple Linear Regression to predict real estate prices based on various features, such as house age, proximity to MRT stations, and convenience stores. This project uses historical market data from Taipei, Taiwan, and aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of regression modeling in real estate valuation.

🏫 Overview
The goal of PriceScope is to predict the price per unit area of a property using various independent features. The key features considered are house age, distance to MRT stations, number of nearby convenience stores, and geographic coordinates. The project applies a simple linear regression model to determine which features have the most significant impact on property prices.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the Real Estate Valuation Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing historical property information from Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan. Key columns include:

House age (years)
Distance to nearest MRT station (meters)
Number of convenience stores nearby
Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude)
Price of unit area (target variable)
